<H1>FAQ with Answers about the 500-mile email</H1>

</P>

<P> I've been receiving a lot of responses to the <a
href="500milemail.html">500-mile email story</a>. Since I originally
posted it, it has been forwarded massively, far beyond anything I
anticipated.  While most of the responses are just to say, "thanks,
fun story" or the like, and some have been solicitations for work
(thanks, and keep them coming!), a not-insubstantial portion have been
of, might I say, the nit-picking variety.  Rather than reiterate the
points again and again, I've compiled these answers to
frequently-asked questions.</P>

<OL>
  <LI> Did this actually happen, or were you just spinning a yarn?
  </LI>
  <P>
    Yes, it happened.  At the time, I was running the centralized
    campus email system, Isis, at the University of North Carolina at
    Chapel Hill. I was informally responsible for some aspects of the
    email systems in departments who chose to run their own
    independent systems.  Most notably for the purposes of this story,
    I wrote sendmail.cf (Sendmail
    configuration) files that were used in most of the mail servers on
    the campus.
  </P>
  <LI> When was this? </LI>
  <P> I wish I could say for certain.  I'm one of those anal-retentive
  types who save <EM>all</EM> my back email, sent and received, but
  some simple searches haven't produced any mail on the subject--not
  that I recall engaging in any.  The initial contact, as I wrote in
  the post, was by telephone, as was the resolution.  After that time,
  I <EM>chose</EM> not to write email about it, basically because it's
  a good story and I liked seeing the faces of people who had never
  heard it when I told it to them.  My guess, from
  the office I remember being in, the coworkers I remember speaking
  about this to, and some other such irrelevant but timely details,
  place it somewhere between 1994 and 1997.
  </P>
  <P>
    That said, it <EM>should</EM> be possible to reconstruct an
    approximate time.  When was Sendmail V8 "fairly mature", but Sun
    still shipping Sendmail V5?  Eric Allman notes in a personal
    correspondence that the
    Sendmail V5 in question might have had backported features from
    Sendmail V8, so that might narrow it down.  If you have any data
    that could assist with nailing down a timeframe, I'd appreciate it
    if you passed it along.
  </P>

  <LI> Was it actually you, or was your identity one of the
    "irrelevant details" that you altered? </LI>
  <P> It was really me.  I <EM>think</EM> that I may have been alerted
    to "some situation in statistics" by one of my coworkers prior to
    actually speaking to the chairman.  I may have even called the
    chairman
    rather than his calling me.  And it is possible--even likely--that
    one of my coworkers was sitting with me during some of the
    resolution, as I frequently talk out problems while I work them.
    But I don't believe I'm taking credit for anyone else's work.  (If
    you're one of those former coworkers and disagree, <EM>please</EM>
    let me know and I will rectify the situation as best I can.)
  </P>

  <LI> If you're not 100% certain of all the details, why did you
    write the original post so vividly? </LI>
  <P> I took license.  It made a better story that way.  Honestly,
  would writing "I'm not sure, but maybe..." every second sentence really
  have changed anything?  And I <EM>did</EM> say at the start that I
  was changing or eliding irrelevant details for the sake of the story.
  </P>
  <P>
  Another factor is the context in which this originally appeared.  It
  was posted to the sage-members list, a list for members of 
  SAGE, the System Administrators Guild, in a thread about
  "favorite impossible tasks".  That is to say, it was a
  light-hearted discussion about the impossible tasks that users or
  management sometimes bring to sysadmins to solve.
  </P>
  <P> If I had any notion that this post would be forwarded so widely,
  I would have added some details to answer the questions of skeptics.
  But I was posting to a list of colleagues, a good proportion of
  whom I know personally, and so was tailoring it for an audience
  inclined to believe me. :-)
  </P>
  
  <LI> The story is fun, but the technical details at the end just
    don't add up. </LI>
  <P> I know.  See the answer to the previous question.  First and
  foremost, I was writing a humorous story based on an actual
  occurence, not a case study, so I wrote only what was required to
  get the point across.  I find I suddenly have great respect for
  writers who write works based on true stories, as I now know how
  hard it is to find the balance between verisimilitude and
  storytelling. And I now know the kind of criticism you open yourself
  up to when you choose storytelling over verisimilitude.  :-)
  </P>
  
  <LI> Well, why don't you write a case study, with all the details?
    </LI>
  <P> Unfortunately, I couldn't write a case study today if I
  wanted to, because I now lack the raw data.  I didn't keep logs of
  what I found, and I no longer have the notes I took at the time.  I
  really, <EM>really</EM> wish I had, as I now see I could have
  published a
  paper on it.  At the time it seemed trivial, other than as a fun
  story to tell folks to get a laugh.  It still works for that, even
  without the notes.
  </P>
  <P>
    That said, there <EM>are</EM> details that I didn't put into the
    story that I do remember, or can reconstruct.  That is what most
    of the next questions have to do with.
  </P>
  
  <LI> That three millisecond time doesn't make sense as the timeout
    for a connect() call. </LI>
  <P>
Yes, I know.  And it wasn't the timeout, actually.  In the story, I
make it sound like it took all of ten minutes from being made aware of
the 500-mile email limit and determining a 3 ms light-speed issue.  In
fact, this took several hours, and quite a bit of detective work.  The
point is, eventually I came up with that figure, ran units, and gagged
on my latte.  (I'm fairly certain it was a different latte from the
one I started with.)  So what, in particular, is your question about
the 3 ms figure?
  </P>
  
  <LI> Well, to start with, it can't be three milliseconds, because
    that would only be for the outgoing packet to arrive at its
    destination.  You have to get a response, too, before the timeout
    will be aborted. Shouldn't it be <EM>six</EM> milliseconds?</LI>
  <P>
    Of course.  This is one of the details I skipped in the story.  It
    seemed irrelevant, and boring, so I left it out.
  </P>
  
  <LI> Actually, shouldn't it be twelve/eighteen/twenty-four
    milliseconds, to account for the three-way TCP handshake? </LI>
  <P> Maybe.  Again, this would be a detail my lost notes would
  answer.  But I think that a connect() timeout would be aborted upon
  receiving a SYN/ACK packet; I don't think that the whole handshake
  had to be completed.  Even if it did, I eventually would have
  arrived at the 3 ms figure, however I got to it.
  </P>
  
  <LI> Router delays would have been a much greater factor than you
    admit in the story. </LI>
  <P> Yes, you're probably right.  But they are factors I could
  account for.  I'm not certain this is how I did it, but it seems
  likely I could have pinged the nearest router I could find (such as
  one at another school at UNC that manged its own network) to find
  out what sort of delay a router was likely to add.  Then I could
  multiply that by the number of routers to remote destinations.  The
  number was likely to be constant for other East Coast universities.
  And even if it wasn't, the delay imposed by an additional router
  would only be on the order of a few hundred
  microseconds at most, not enough to make a large difference for
  nearby destinations.
  </P>
  
  <LI> The story is cute, but it has a fatal flaw: signals don't
    travel at lightspeed in copper. </LI>
  <P> That's true, they travel at 3 <EM>c</EM> / 4 or thereabouts.
    But the NIC, the campus backbone, and certainly the Internet
    backbone was all fiber.
  </P>
  
  <LI> Ah-hah!  But signals don't travel at light speed in fiber,
    either!
  </LI>
  <P> You got me.  I'm told they travel at from 2 <EM>c</EM> / 3
    (yes, <EM>slower</EM> than copper) up to a few percent under
    <EM>c</EM> depending on a wide variety of factors.  But again,
    this was a factor I could, and did, account for.  I recall
    pinging various destinations and writing down distances versus
    ping times, and coming up with an empirical "effective time" that
    differed from actual time.  This was just another "irrelevant and
    boring detail" to be left out of the story.
  </P>
  
  <LI> Wait, doesn't that mean that you knew what was going
    on--i.e. that speed-of-light had something to do with
    the problem--before you typed that figure into units?</LI>
  <P>
    Yep, I did.  But I was stubborn.  Have you ever averted your eyes
    from the answer to a riddle while you worked it out for yourself?
    That was what I did.  I could have typed "500 miles" into units and
    worked backwards, but once I knew what going on, it was an
    intellectual challenge to be figured out.
  </P>
  
  <LI> So you knew how to solve the problem the department was having
    sending email, but you left it alone until you figured out the
    timeout issue? </LI>
  <P>
    No--as soon as I knew that replacing the SunOS sendmail
    binary with the Sendmail V8 binary would fix the problem, I did
    so.  (Even if I didn't know this would fix it, I would have done
    so, as running Sendmail V5 with a V8 cf file is definitely not a
    recommended configuration.)  But I kept the other binary around so
    that I could continue
    experimenting with it at my leisure.
  </P>
  <P>
    Sysadmins do that sort of thing all the time.  The answer to a
    bug is never "the system has been up too long," but
    rebooting the system is still sometimes the right answer, simply
    because it has the <EM>effect</EM> of fixing the problem.  You fix
    a problem, any way you can, in order to rectify a production
    issue, and then you come back later to try to determine what the
    "right" solution is.
  </P>
  
  <LI> The Internet
    travels all sorts of circuitious routes. But the 500-mile email
    story depends on the packets travelling a
    direct path between source and destination, doesn't it?</LI>
  <P> No, it doesn't.  As I wrote in the story, the
  500-miles-plus-a-bit was a <EM>maximum</EM> radius outside of which
  it was <EM>impossible</EM> to send email.  Within that radius, there
  were plenty of sites to which sending mail was also impossible, or
  at least sporadic.
  </P>
  <P>
    There's at least two possible reasons for this.  One is that some other
    delay--from a firewall, for instance--was long enough to hit the
    connect timeout.  Another is that the
    sites within that radius that mail couldn't reach were accessed
    via a network path that deviated enough from great-circle to make
    it longer than the maximum radius.  
  </P>
  <P> UNC was a very well-connected East Coast university, so the
  path to other East Coast universities (which were where the majority
  of successful mails were sent to) would closely resemble a
  great circle, especially at the time in which the story was set,
  when it was rather rare to see a packet going to San Jose in order
  to get from Atlanta to Washington.
  </P>
  
  <LI> So why did you feel the need to include the detail about the
    campus being 100% switched? </LI>
  <P> You know, I'm not actually sure.  At the time, it seemed the
  most glaring problem with the plausibility of the story, so I put it
  in.  I'm not sure why in retrospect.  Feel free to delete that paragraph
  mentally upon second reading.
  </P>
  <P> Hacksaw writes: "Switched means no other delays, like losing the
  collision detection game. It makes it somewhat easier to detect
  things like this, since there is less noise in the data. I bet
  that's what you were thinking."
  </P>
  
  <LI> Sendmail V5 wouldn't accept a Sendmail V8 cf file. </LI>
  <P> But it did.  I'm told that the Sendmail V5 on the net
  wouldn't have.  So therefore, I'm forced to conclude that the one
  Sun shipped with Solaris had tweaks to enable it to do so.
  If you have access to that source, I'd love independent
  verification.  But it happened, therefore it's possible. :-)
  </P>
  
  <LI> Sendmail has defaults compiled into the binary; it wouldn't
    simply assign missing options a value of zero. </LI>
  <P> Several people have written me alleging this.  It may be true
  today, but it was
  definitely not true with that sendmail at that time.  I am certain
  of this, because a year or two after this happened, I was in a
  Sendmail tutorial at LISA with Eric Allman.  He mentioned that
  sendmail doesn't have defaults for the options he was describing.
  (The standard sendmail.cf files did have defaults, but that is
  irrelevant in this case.)  I
  took that opportunity to tell him the story of the 500-mile email.
  He literally fell to the floor in pain. :-)
  </P>
  
  <LI> units on SunOS doesn't know about "millilightseconds."  </LI>
  <P> Yes.  So?  I used to populate my units.dat file with tons of
  extra prefixes and units.  And actually, I think I was using AIX to
  run units; I don't know if it knew about millilightseconds.  Take a
  look at the units.dat shipped with Linux these days.  It definitely
  knows about millilightseconds.
  </P>
  
  <LI> These "lost notes" you refer to sound awfully convenient. </LI>
  <P>
    Yes, well, how many pieces of scratch paper from five years ago do
    <EM>you</EM> still have?
  </P>
  
  <LI> Well, the story still can't be true. </LI>
  <P>
    Let me ask <EM>you</EM> a question: regardless of the details, is
    it possible that a
    misconfiguration could cause the operational behavior of
    nearby email being delivered while faraway email was not?  I think
    the answer is yes.  In fact, I <EM>know</EM> the answer is yes,
    because it happened.  But even putting aside my own experience and
    viewing it as best I can as a skeptical observer, I think the idea
    is possible, though certainly implausible at first gloss.
  </P>
  <P> If you have a question that isn't answered here, go ahead and
  email me at trey+500mi@lopsa.org.  I may put it in the FAQ and credit
  you.  But I'm more likely to just say, "I don't know, I don't
  remember and no longer have the raw data to answer your question."
  </P>
  
  <LI> The signature says you're looking for work.  Are you still?

  <P>Nope, but thanks for asking!</P>
